# bokmal_vocabulary
A simple vocabulary app for learning new words in Bokmål. It might be helpful for complete beginners in Bokmål like myself to memorize basic Norwegian vocabulary.
Vocabulary is derived from self made list available at: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vS06w7mvCUDIZCQklI2cg3-VfhqJPGGMQk-k2Pd3r7W3i2OEkdSIk4BncwP8WiXp8dRQUUEh2ybogA8/pubhtml. List will be updated weekly as I will be learning new words hopefully.
This is my first experience with PyQt5 python library and Qt designer tool, so functionality is not so rich and some bugs may occur;)

NOR-ENG translation coming soon...

Ha en hyggelig dag!
